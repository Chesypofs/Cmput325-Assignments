# Cmput325-Assignments

These are the 4 assignments related to the Cmput 325 - Non-Procedural Programming Languages class at the University of Alberta.
Assignments 1 and 2 are related to Lisp, while assignments 3 and 4 are related to Prolog.

Assignment 1: Implementation of some simple Lisp functions to get used to working in Lisp.

Assignment 2: An interpreter for the Fun programming language written in Lisp.

Assignment 3: Implementation of some simple Prolog predicates to get used to working in Prolog.

Assignment 4: Deals with Constraint Logic Programming. Implemented 2 predicates, the first decomposes positive integers into the sum of 4 squares, while the second takes 2 lists of military strengths of 2 countries (represented as positive integers), and finds a series of dismantlements of military divisions such that:
  1. Each dismantlement is less than or equal to the next.
  2. Each dismantlement includes 1 division from 1 country, and 2 divisions from the other country.
  3. Before and after each dismantlement the countries have equal total military strength.
  4. At the end of the series both countries have a military strength of 0.
